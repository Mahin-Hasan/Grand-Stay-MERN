#### 7 features and functionality of my project is described below:

+ This website is based on hotel booking platform similar to Airbnb, providing a seamless experience for users to browse, filter, book, and manage accommodations.
+ There are three different user roles [Admin, Host, Guest]. Based on user role websites interface will change dynamically.
+ Admin will be able to monitor overall statistics and manage user roles.  
+ A Host will be able to add, update and delete hosted rooms. A host can also manage bookings.
+ Guests are responsible for booking properties and can request to become a host which can be approved by the Admin.
+ For Backend and database I have implemented express and mongoDB.
+ For User Authentication I have implemented Firebase Authentication with multiple verification and validation process alongside JWT and stored token in browser cookie.
+ I have Implemented Private Routes which ensure users must log in before performing any operation in the site.
+ Secured payment gateway integration
